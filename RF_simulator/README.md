# RF signal simulator

The RF signal simulator is described in detail in Section II.A of the *IEEE TMI* article.

**Fig. 2. RF signal simulator. a** *For each simulation, the number of microbubbles is randomly selected. The bubbles are randomly distributed in a two-dimensional domain. A virtual P4-1 transducer emits a short-pulse plane wave which excites the bubbles. All bubble echoes arriving at the center element are added up and convolved with the receive impulse response of the transducer to produce an RF signal.* **b** *Pulse shape. For each simulation, the acoustic pressure is randomly selected.* **c** *Each bubble is assigned a random radius. The radial oscillation R(t) is computed by solving a Rayleigh-Plesset equation. From R(t), the scattered pressure is computed.*
