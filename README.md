![Method overview!](FigureOverview.png "Method overview")

**Fig. 1** **Methods overview.** **1** *A randomly distributed microbubble cloud (random number of bubbles and random coordinates) serves as input to a simulator that generates one-dimensional (1D) RF signals. The individual bubble radii are drawn from a narrow (monodisperse) distribution. The acoustic pressure amplitude is also randomly selected.* **2** *The bubble coordinates are also used to compute the 1D ground truth distributions (arrival times of bubble echoes).* **3** *A 1D dilated convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained with a dual-loss function to detect and localize microbubbles in an RF signal.*

The code is organized into three folders:
* ðŸ“‚ **RF_simulator:** RF signal simulation and ground truth generation (Fig. 1, step 1 and 2). Section II.A in the article.
* ðŸ“‚ **Network:**      Neural network training and evaluation (Fig. 1, step 3). Sections II.B, II.C, II.D.1 in the article.
* ðŸ“‚ **DelayAndSum:**  Delay-and-sum image reconstruction with unprocessed and deconvolved RF signals. Section II.D.2 in the article.


## Required software

* RF_simulator: MATLAB with Signal Processing Toolbox
* Network: Python with PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy
* DelayAndSum: MATLAB
